## The challenge

You have 48 hours to complete this challenge. If you need more time or you have any queries, feel free to reach out to us.

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You have to use [React](https://reactjs.org). You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project; [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is preferred but you can use any CSS framework/library or just plain CSS.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Web App should be responsive. Desktop and Mobile designs are provided inside the `/design` folder.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project.
3. Regularly commit the code with proper commit message.
